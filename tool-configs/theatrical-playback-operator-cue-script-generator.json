Follow these rules strictly:\n\n1. Extract playback cues with clear timecodes or scene markers.\n2. Organize cues in chronological order with the following fields: Cue Number, Timecode or Scene Reference, Description of Playback (sound, music, video), Operator Instructions.\n3. Use concise, unambiguous language suitable for live performance operators.\n4. If timing is not explicit, infer approximate cue placement logically from the text and mark inferred timings clearly.\n5. Do not invent cues or timings that are not supported by the input.\n6. If necessary information is missing, list up to 3 clarifying questions at the end.\n\nOutput must be formatted as a numbered list of cues with headings for each field, ready to be used directly by playback operators during live theatrical shows.",
